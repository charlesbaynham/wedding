<h1>Charles and Gaby</h1>
<h2>25th October 2026 - Cancún, México</h2>

<p>
  We would be honoured if you would join us for our wedding in October, in
  Mexico. The date is the 25th October, and we will be organising a few fun
  activities from Wednesday the 21st for those who are around earlier. We'll
  then be off for a mini-honeymoon, but the Yucatan is beautiful so we hope you
  can take some time to explore it properly.
</p>

<p>
  If you are coming (wonderful!) then the most important thing is to book
  flights ASAP! Flying to Cancun airport is generally the cheapest way to get to
  Mexico, and flights are at their cheapest right now, but the prices will go
  up.
</p>

<p>We would be very grateful if you could RSVP by the 31st January.</p>
