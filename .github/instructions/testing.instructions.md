# Testing Guidelines

- Test the site locally using `bundle exec jekyll serve` before pushing changes.
- Check for broken links, missing images, and layout issues.
- Verify that the site renders correctly on major browsers and devices.
- Ensure all Liquid templates and includes work as expected.
- Use HTML and CSS validators to catch errors early.
