# Ceremony

We are having a Mayan wedding in the beautiful Cenote Zapote and we are thrilled that you can join us. We're not sure of the exact timings yet, but if you know us you'll know that we're not morning people.

The ceremony and reception will be in the same place and will be relaxed and informal. We do have one special request however: please wear white! It will be up to 30C so Charles will be in a short-sleeved linen shirt, Gaby in a typically floaty dress of some sort. If you're looking for ideas, I recommend a [Guayabera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayabera) for men - they're fantastic for everyday use too.

## Gifts

Absolutely none please. You have all travelled very far to be here with us - we are already favoured to our hearts' content.
