# Setup Jekyll Component Prompt

You are tasked with creating a new Jekyll include, layout, or reusable component. Ask for the component's purpose, required data, and where it will be used. Follow project conventions:

- Use semantic HTML5
- Use Liquid for dynamic content
- Place includes in `_includes/`, layouts in `_layouts/`
- Reference Bootstrap and Font Awesome as needed
- Document usage in `README.md` or comments
