# HTML, Markdown, and Liquid Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML5 elements for structure and accessibility.
- Write clean, readable markup with proper indentation.
- Use Liquid for dynamic content and templating.
- Place reusable components in `_includes/` and layouts in `_layouts/`.
- Use YAML front matter for all pages and posts.
- Avoid inline styles and scripts; keep CSS and JS in their respective folders.
